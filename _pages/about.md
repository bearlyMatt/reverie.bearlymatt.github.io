(bearly)Matt is a game designer based out of Kinross, Scotland with a penchance for the odd. He began his journey with solo rpg: [Sonata: The Life of Music](https://bearlymatt.itch.io/sonata), swiftly followed closely by the two-player [Melodie](https://bearlymatt.itch.io/melodie).

Taking the trifold leaflet layout to heart, (bearly)Matt created the [Library of Roleplaying Oddities](https://bearlymatt.itch.io) (BLRO) to showcase a wide variety of themes and mechanics utilising this format.

The BLRO blog contains dev diaries, deep dives, and random thoughts about game design
