(bearly)Matt is a game designer based out of Kinross, Scotland with a penchance for the odd. An avid reader and videogame player, Matt fell down the TTRPG rabbit hole alongside millions of other nerds with the introduction of Dungeons and Dragons 5e. From there Matt played and DM-ed sessions of 5e, Star Wars Edge of the Empire, Symbaroum, Heart: the City Beneath and Unity RPG, alongside many others. 

By day Matt can be found optimising data analysis and visualisations for the Finance Sector, and, other than gaming, loves coffee, reading, light walks in the forest, and social isolation (son and wife exempt).

The BLRO blog contains dev diaries, deep dives, and random thoughts about game design.
